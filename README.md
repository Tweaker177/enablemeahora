An awesome switch tweak to change the color, thickness and many other features of UISwitches. 
Goal is to make system wide without bugs; right now is only affecting Settings app and Flex 3.
Also want to clean up un-needed additional methods that are hooked, add further customization options for the knob shape and size,
as well as add some similar features for UISliders system wide.

Project can be downloaded and used in .deb format by adding my repo: http://i0s-tweak3r-betas.yourepo.com
While at the time of writing this, the version in repo is from this exact code, the most recent version will always be in the repo.
I plan on trying to keep the GitHub pages current tho with the code used for version in repo, but at times it may be behind.

To compile this tweak resources need added to theos directories available here:
